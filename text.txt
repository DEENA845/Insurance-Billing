    public class User
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }

        [Required]
        public string Name { get; set; }

        [Required]
        [EmailAddress]
        public string Email { get; set; }

    }
}
these are the details have been given by the user when the user register and for then login purpose after this all the operations have to done in  a dashboard page , but here the registered details is not storing in a database and it need to store data in a database and then , it have to fetch the details for login purpose and after the successfull login it need to redirects to the  dashboard page and all the operations have to be taken place    in the dashboard
